<p>Iron County (pop. 6,200) is located on the border with the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It is Wisconsinâ€™s oldest county, with a median age of 56. It is also the least densely populated, the third least population, and has a low median household incomes. This last fact likely reflects the fixed incomes of its many retired residents, given that the poverty rate is about equal to the state average. During the 2000s, Iron County was closely competitive during presidential elections and voted for Democrats in races for governor and US Senate. In the 2010s, the county has shifted hard towards the Republican Party.</p>

<p>The City of Hurley and Town of Mercer both have around 1,400 residents, making them nearly twice as large as any other municipality in Iron County. Most municipalities are strongly Republican, but handful of them have occasionally voted for a Democratic candidate in recent election cycles, including the Town of Anderson in the 2022 gubernatorial election and the Town of Gurney in the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
