<p>Oneida County (pop. 38,000) is located in north central Wisconsin. It’s population is 94% white and much older than the state average. Relative to some other northern counties, a somewhat higher share of its population has attended at least some college. The county shifted Republican during the 2010s, but not as strongly as some of its neighbors.</p>
