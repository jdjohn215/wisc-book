<p>Two cities, Janesville and Beloit, account for 62% of the county’s population, while several other communities also include more than 5,000 residents. The Democratic lean to Rock County comes from these more populous municipalities, including the cities of Evansville, Edgerton, Beloit, and Janesville. Many of the less populous rural towns, including Clinton, Bradford, Newark, and Avon, are strongly Republican.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
