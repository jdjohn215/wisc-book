<p>Much of Langlade County (pop. 20,000) lies within the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. The population is 93% white, with a median age significantly above the state average. About 16% of the population over the age of 24 has a college degree. As with most northern Wisconsin counties, Langlade has shifted sharply toward the Republican party over the past two decades.</p>
