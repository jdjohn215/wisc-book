<p>Green County (pop. 37,000) is located between Dane County and the Illinois border. Despite having fairly low population density and a generally rural appearance, the county has enough economic ties to its northern neighbor to be part of the Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area. Among all races for president, governor, or US Senator since 2000, a Republican candidate carried Green County in only the 2012 gubernatorial recall election. That being said, Democratic margins of victory in the county have often been slight. Clinton won the county by 2.3 points in 2016, Biden by 3.2 in 2020, and Harris by 0.3 points in 2024.</p>

<p>About 30% of Green Countyâ€™s population lives in the City of Monroe. Unlike in many counties, the largest municipalities in Green County are not the most Democratic-leaning. Rather, a pronounced north/south dimension characterizes Green County politics, with those municipalities nearest Madison leaning most Democratic, while the southern half of the county leans more Republican.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
