<p>Monroe County (pop. 46,000) is located east of La Crosse in south central Wisconsin. A large part of the county’s area is occupied by Fort McCoy, a military training base. The county’s population is 89% white, with a median age identical to the state average. Somewhat fewer of the county’s adult residents have a college degree than the state average, while the poverty rate closely matches Wisconsin overall. Politically, the county leans Republican. It gave the 2002 Libertarian candidate for governor a plurality of the vote.</p>
