<p>Vernon County (pop. 31,000) is located in the Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin. Its population is 95% white, with lower college attendance than the state average. Incomes are also somewhat lower and poverty rates are higher. Politically, the county is very competitive. Donald Trump won the county in both 2016 and 2018. However, the Democratic candidate won the governor’s race in 2014, 2018, and 2022.</p>

<p>Vernon County’s population is spread across many small communities. The largest, Viroqua city, has 4,500 residents, or about 15% of the county’s total. Viroqua is also the most Democratic-leaning community. It gave a higher share of support to the Democratic candidate in each of the last 3 gubernatorial races. Some other communities also typically lean Democratic, while many of the more rural towns consistently support Republicans. Other places, like the City of Hillsboro, are themselves quite competitive.</p>
