<p>Milwaukee county (pop. 933,000) is, by far, the state’s largest, holding about 16% of Wisconsin’s total population. While internally segregated, the county’s overall population is notably diverse. Non-Hispanic white people make up slightly less than half the county’s population, Black residents 26%, Hispanic or Latino residents 16%, and Asian residents 5%. The county’s median age and income are lower than the state average. Poverty rates are much higher, while educational attainment is similar to the state overall. Politically, the county is a Democratic stronghold. Margins of victory for Demcoratic candidates have increased in recent years.</p>

<p>About 61% of the county’s population lives in the City of Milwaukee. The largest suburbs are West Allis (60,000) and Wauwatosa (48,000). Generally speaking, the “north shore” suburbs are wealthier and have (with the exception of Brown Deer and Glendale) large white majorities. These suburbs have shifted very strongly toward the Democratic party since the emergence of Donald Trump on the political scene. In fact, the City of Milwaukee, which has seen little overall political change over the last several cycles, is no longer the most Democratic-leaning community in the county. That distinction now belongs to the Village of Shorewood. Milwaukee County’s southern and southwestern suburbs tend to be more conservative. But even these historically Republican-leaning municipalities have shifted toward the Democrats in recent cycles–even as much of the rest of the state has moved in a Republican direction.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
