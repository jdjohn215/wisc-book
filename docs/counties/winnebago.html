<p>Winnebago County (pop. 172,000) is located along Lake Winnebago in Wisconsin’s Fox Valley region. The county is generally demographically similar to the state as a whole, and its politics are closely divided between Democrats and Republicans. George Bush won the state twice, followed by Obama twice, then Trump twice. Trump’s margin of victory declined from 7 points to 4 points from 2016 to 2020. The 2022 gubernatorial race was settled by a single percentage point.</p>

<p>About 39% of Winnebago County lives in the City of Oshkosh (pop. 66,000), home to UW-Oshkosh. Another 27,000 live in the City of Neenah, 20,000 in the Village of Fox Crossing, and 15,000 in the City of Menasha. All of these communities are fairly politically competitive, with Oskhosh leaning the most Democratic.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
