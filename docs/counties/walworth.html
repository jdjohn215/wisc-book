<p>About 12,000 people live in the portion of the City of Whitewater located in Walworth County. Another 10,000 live in the City of Elkhorn. (A tiny sliver of the City of Burlington is also located in the county.) The City of Whitewater, home to UW-Whitewater, is a consistently Democratic-leaning community. The other communities within the state tend to vote for Republicans.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
