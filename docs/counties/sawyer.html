<p>Sawyer County (pop. 18,000) is located in northwestern Wisconsin. The Lac Courte Oreilles Band’s reservation is mostly located in the county, and 15% of the total population identifies as Native American alone. The average age of the county is 11 years older than the state average, while the median income is much lower. Politically, the county leans Republican, but the margins are smaller than in some neighboring counties in the region.</p>
