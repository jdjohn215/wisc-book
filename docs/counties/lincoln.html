<p>Lincoln County (pop. 28,000) is much like its neighboring counties in northern Wisconsin. The population is 94% white, older than average, and with relatively low levels of college attainment. Politically, the county has moved from competitive, or even Democratic-leaning, during the 2000s to solidy Republican during the 2010s and beyond.</p>
