<p>Located about 60 miles north of Madison, Marquette County (pop. 16,000) is a rural county outside of any metro or micropolitan statistical area. Its population is 92% white and a decade older than the state average. College graduates make up just 15% of the county’s over-24 population–one of the lowest levels in the state. After a series of fairly competitive elections in the 2000s, Republicans opened a wide lead in the state beginning around 2010.</p>

<p>Marquette County’s population is distributed across a range of small municipalities. Packwaukee Town is the most population, with about 1,600 residents. The City of Montello has 1,400 and Montello Town has 1,300. All communities typically give a majority of their vote to Republican candidates; although, City of Montello did vote for Tony Evers in 2018 and a handful of places voted for Tammy Baldwin in that year as well.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
