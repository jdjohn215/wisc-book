<p>Ozaukee County (pop. 92,000) is located just north of Milwaukee County. Part of the Milwaukee metro, it is one of the suburban “WOW” counties, traditionally the state’s most important Republican stronghold. Ozaukee County, however, while still Republican-leaning, has moved sharply in a Democratic direction since 2016. The county is one of Wisconsin’s most wealthy and highly educated. It has the lowest poverty rate in the state.</p>

<p>Ozaukee’s largest municipality is the City of Mequon, followed by Port Washington, Cedarburg, and Grafton. All four of these municipalities gave Clinton a larger share of the vote in 2016 than Obama won in 2012. And they all once again gave Biden a greater share in 2020 than Clinton in 2016, followed by a greater share for Harris in 2024 than Biden in 2020. The more rural towns in the northern part of the county have remained more Republican leaning and have, in some cases, actually shifted in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
