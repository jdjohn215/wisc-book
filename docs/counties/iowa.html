<p>Iowa County (pop. 24,000) is located in Wisconsinâ€™s hilly Driftless Area, immediately west of Dane County. Despite being predominately rural, it is part of the Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area, and its politics reflect that connection. The county has voted consistently for Democrats for decades. Its population is 93% white, with both median ages and incomes that exceed the state average.</p>
