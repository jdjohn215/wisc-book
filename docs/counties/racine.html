Despite this location, it is not share a metro area with either, instead being part of the single-county Racine Metropolitan Statistical Area. Racine County’s population is relatively racially diverse, and its population comes close to state averages in terms of educational attainment, age, income, and poverty. The county has remained consistently competitive between the two parties for the past two decades, albeit with a slight Republican lean.</p>

<p>About 77,000 people live in the City of Racine, while a combined 53,000 live in the two adjacent villages of Mount Pleasant and Caledonia. The City of Racine is a Democratic party stronghold, while the more western parts of the county vote more Republican. Some of the traditionally Republican-leaning suburban communities have tilted more towards the Democrats since Trump’s 2016 campaign.</p>
