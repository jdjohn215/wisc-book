<p>Vilas County (pop. 21,000) is located in the middle of Wisconsin’s border with Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. A popular tourist destination, its population has grown in recent years. With a median age of 55, it has the second oldest population among Wisconsin counties. The Lac du Flambeau Reservation is partly in Vilas County, and this is reflected in the 9% of the county’s population who identifies as Native American alone. Educational attainment in the county is similar to the state as a whole. Politically, the county is a Republican stronghold.</p>
