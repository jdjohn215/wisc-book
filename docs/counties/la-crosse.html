<p>La Crosse County (pop. 120,000) lies on the Mississippi River across from Minnesota and just north of the intersection of those two states with Iowa. The county is 88% white and has relatively high degrees of educational attainment, reflecting the presence of UW-La Crosse. Politically, it votes consistently for Democrats, showing no signs of that changing during the Trump era.</p>

<p>About 50,000 people live in the City of La Crosse, while roughly another 20,000 live in adjacent Onalaska City and another 10,000 in the Vilalge of Holmen to its north. La Crosse and these surrounding communities make up the largest urban concentration in this part of the state and they account for the countyâ€™s consistent Democratic tilt.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
