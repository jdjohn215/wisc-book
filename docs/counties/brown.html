<p>Brown County (pop. 268,000) is Wisconsin’s 4th largest county and the largest in the northern half of the state. Across many demographic measures–age, race, education, income–it closely mirrors state averages. Politically, it also reflects the political divisions of the state, although it leans slightly more Republican that the state overall. Looking back to 2000, Republicans have won all but 1 presidential race, every gubernatorial contest, and half the US Senate contests in Brown County.</p>

<p>About 40% of Brown county’s population lives in the City of Green Bay, which is also the most Democratic community. Even Green Bay is not overwhelmingly Democratic, in contrast to some of Wisconsin’s other cities. Scott Walker won the city in his 2014 reelection campaign. In 2020, Biden won only Green Bay and the Village of Allouez. Trump won every other community; although, the City of De Pere was nearly tied.</p>
