<p>Washington County (pop. 137,000) is a suburban county in the Milwaukee metro, part of the suburban “WOW” counties along with Waukesha to its south and Ozaukee to its east. Washington’s population is 91% white. Its educational attainment is similar to the state as a whole, but its median household income is much higher than typical. Politically, the county is a Republican stronghold–showing few of the signs of Trump-era weakness for the Republican party common among other suburban communities.</p>

<p>The City of West Ben (pop. 32,000) is the largest Washington County municipality, followed by the Village of Germantown (pop. 21,000). Every community in the county leans strongly Republican; although, both West Bend and Germantown have seen some recent shifts toward Democrats in presidential and gubernatorial races.</p>
