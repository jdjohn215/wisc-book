<p>Lafayette County (pop. 17,000) is on Wisconsin’s southwestern border with Illinois, outside of any metro- or micropolitan statistical area. Its population is 93% white and only 20% of the population over 24 has a college degree. Still, the median age, income, and poverty rate are all close to the state average. The county has shifted toward Republicans in recent years but it remains fairly competitive.</p>
