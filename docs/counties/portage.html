<p>Portage County (pop. 70,000) is located in almost the exact center of Wisconsin, and its population is demographically similar to the state as a whole in terms of educational attainment, age, income, poverty, and population density. The county is quite closely contested by both parties; although, Democrats have enjoyed a slight advantage in recent elections.</p>

<p>About 26,000 people live in the City of Stevens Point (home to UW-Stevens Point), while another 14,000 live in nearby Plover village. Stevens Point accounts for the Democratic lean of the county, along with a few other smaller municipalities. Plover is closely divided between the parties, and many more rural towns lean conservative.</p>
