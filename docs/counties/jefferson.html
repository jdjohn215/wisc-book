<p>Jefferson County (pop. 86,000) is located in between Dane and Milwaukee counties, but it lies outside of either Madison or Milwaukee’s metropolitan statistical areas. Along many demographic measures, it is quite similar to the state average. Politically, it has long voted reliably Republican, with no signs of that changing during the Trump era.</p>

<p>Jefferson County includes portions of two cities which partially lie in other counties, Watertown and Whitewater. The largest city wholly within the county is Fort Atkinson (pop. 13,000). The communities in Jefferson County are politically disparate. Some, like the Village of Palmyra, the county’s portion of Watertown City, and many of the rural towns are reliably Republican. Others, like the Village of Cambridge, the cities of Whitewater, Fort Atkinson, and Lake Mills frequently vote for Democrats.</p>
