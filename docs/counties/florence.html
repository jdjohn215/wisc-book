<p>Florence County (pop. under 5,000) is Wisconsinâ€™s second least populous county. Located along the border with Michiganâ€™s Upper Peninsula, it has no incorporated municipalitiesâ€“only towns. The population is 95% white, the median age is 55, and relatively few residents have a college degree. The county has long leaned Republican, and that trend has only intensified in recent years.</p>

<p>More than a third of the population lives in the Town of Florence, also the county seat. The remainder of the population is spread across the countyâ€™s 7 other towns, none of whose populations exceed 1,000. The smallest is Long Lake with a population of around 200 residents. All of these towns are solidly Republican-leaning.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
