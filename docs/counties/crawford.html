<p>Located in the Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin, Crawford County (pop. 16,000) has long been more Democratic-leaning than most rural counties in the United States. In recent years, Republicans have improved their performance. Donald Trump won the county in 2020, and it voted Republican in both the gubernatorial and US Senate races in 2022.</p>

<p>About a third of the county lives in the City of Prarie du Chien, which lies in the southwestern part of the county near the confluence of the Mississippi and Wisconsin Rivers. Many other small villages are scattered across the rest of the county, some of which consistently lean Democratic and others which lean Republican.</p>
