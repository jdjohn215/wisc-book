<p>Jackson County (pop. 21,000) is located in Western Wisconsin. Over half the population over the age of 25 has no more than a high school degree, making it one of the Wisconsin counties with the lowest levels of college attendance. Its median household income is lower than the state average and its poverty rate is slightly higher. Politically, the county has shifted from generally Democratic in the 2000s to generally Republican in the 2010s.</p>

<p>Jackson Countyâ€™s largest city is Black River Falls (pop. 3,500). As the dot plots below show, the most politically unusual community in the county is the Town of Komensky, which typically votes for Democratic candidates by very high margins, in contrast to the rest of the county. This likely reflects the large Ho Chunk community living there. About 65% of the town identies as Native American alone.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
