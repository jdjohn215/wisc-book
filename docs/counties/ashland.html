<p>Ashland County (pop. 16,000) is one of 3 counties, along with <a href="counties/bayfield.qmd">Bayfield</a> and <a href="counties/douglas.qmd">Douglas</a>, bordering Lake Superior that have consistentally voted Democratic for decades. In recent years, it has seen a growing partisan divide between the more Democratic areas near the lake and more Republican municipalities in the southern half of the county. The county is much more rural, with lower average income and higher poverty rates, than the state as a whole. Only about 21% of residents have a bachelor’s degree, compared with 32% statewide. About 9% of residents are Native American.</p>
