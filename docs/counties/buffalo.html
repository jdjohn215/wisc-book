<p>Buffalo County (pop. 13,000), which stretches along the bluffs above the upper Mississippi River, tended to vote Democratic during the 2000s, but it has shifted toward Republicans over the last decade. Demographically, Buffalo is somewhat older, whiter, and more rural than the rest of the state. Forty-eight percent of residents over the age of 25 have no more than a high school diploma. Its median income is lower than the state average, but so is its poverty rate.</p>
