<p>Douglas County (pop. 44,000) lies in the extreme northwestern corner of Wisconsin. Over half the county lives in the City of Superior, which is across the Saint Louis Bay from the larger city of Duluth, MN. The county is traditionally Democratic and has a large white working class population, many employed by industries associated with the local port (among the largest on the Great Lakes). Unlike most northwestern Wisconsin counties, Douglas has remained majority Democratic thus far; although, the performance of Republican candidates has improved in recent years.</p>
