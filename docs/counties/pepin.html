<p>Pepin (pop. 7,400) is a small, irregularly-shaped county in west central Wisconsin, along the border with Minnesota. It is perhaps best known as the location of the Little House in the Big Woods (the first book written by Laura Ingalls Wilder). Pepinâ€™s population is 95% white, slightly older than the state average, and with a median income typical for the state. College degrees are less common here than in the state as a whole. The county leaned Democratic during the 2000s, then flipped to Republican leaning around 2010.</p>
