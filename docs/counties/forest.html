<p>Located along the border with Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, much of Forest County (pop. 9,200) lies within the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. Both the Forest County Potawatomi and the Sokaogon Chippewa tribes hold reservation land in the county, and 12% of the population identified as Native American alone in the 2020 census. Overall, the county’s population is older than the state average, incomes are lower, poverty is higher, and fewer residents have college degrees. Politically, the county, which was competitive between the two parties in the early 2000s, has grown increasingly Republican over the past two decades.</p>
