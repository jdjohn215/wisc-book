<p>Richland County (pop. 17,000) is located in southwestern Wisconsin, about 60 miles west of Madison. Its population is 93% white and has lower average levels of educational attainment, a lower median income, and a higher poverty rate than the state average. Politically, the county is competitive, with a Republican lean. Donald Trump won the county twice. Evers carried it in 2018 and narrowly lost it in 2022.</p>

<p>About 30% of the county lives in the City of Richland Center, with the remainder spread across small towns and villages. A variety of political trajectories can be found among these municipalities, but many of them are quite competitive, having delivered majorities to different parties from one election cycle to another.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
