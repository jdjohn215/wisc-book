<p>Columbia County (pop. 58,000) is located just north of Dane County, and it is officially part of the Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area. While economically and geographically connected, the two counties nonetheless feel quite different culturally and politically. More than a fifth of Dane County residents have an advanced degree, compared to just 8% in Columbia. Politically, Columbia is very competitive. Trump narrowly won the county in all 3 races, but Tony Evers also carried the county in both his campaigns for governor. In 2022, the county closely matched the overall state result, by giving Democrat Tony Evers a 4-point victory in the race for governor and Republican Ron Johnson a nearly 2-point victory in the US Senate race.</p>

The most reliably Democratic communities include the cities of Lodi and Portage and the villages of Rio and Poynette. The most Republican places include the villages of Randolph and Firesland and the towns of Courtland and Randolph.</p>
