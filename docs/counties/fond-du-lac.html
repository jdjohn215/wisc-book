<p>Fond du Lac County (pop. 104,000) lies at the southern end of Lake Winnebago. The Republican party was founded in Ripon, a city in the western part of the county, and it has remained a Republican stronghold to this day. Barry Goldwater was the last GOP presidential candidate to lose the county. The county is 87% white and 23% of adults over 25 have a college degree.</p>

<p>All communities in Fond du Lac county tilt Republican, but, ironically, the City of Ripon (birthplace of the Republican Party) is where Democrats do best. The county generally follows the same pattern as other places in Wisconsin, as incorporated cities and villages are more politically competitive while the rural towns are strongly Republican.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
