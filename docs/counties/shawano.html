<p>Shawano County (pop. 41,000) is located in northeastern Wisconsin. The population is 86% white and 6% Native American, reflecting the presence of the Stockbridge–Munsee Community. The county’s adult population has relatively low levels of college attainment and slightly lower median incomes than the state as a whole. The county has long leaned Republican and that tilt has grown over recent cycles.</p>

<p>Shawano County’s largest municipality is the City of Shawano (pop. 9,200). There are 9 other communities with populations between 1,000 and 3,300. The remainder of the population lives in one of the many smaller towns and villages scattered across the county. The City of Shawno, along with most municipalities, leans Republican. The two most Democratic-leaning towns (Bartelme and Red Springs) are small communities with a large Native American population.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county.</p>
