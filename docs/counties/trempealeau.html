<p>Trempealeau County (pop. 31,000) is located in western Wisconsin, where the southern half of the county touches the Mississippi River. The county’s population is 88% white and 9% Hispanic. Levels of college attendance are lower than the state average, but Trempealeau closely matches the average income and age for Wisconsin. The county voted consistently Democratic during the 2000s but has flipped to the Republican party since then.</p>
