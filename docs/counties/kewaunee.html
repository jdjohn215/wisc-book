<p>The largest municipality is Algoma City (pop. 3,200), followed by Kewaunee City (pop. 2,800), and Luxembourg Village (pop. 2,700). The City of Algoma is unusual among these municipalities in that it has actually moved in a Democratic direction over the last several election cycles. After voting for Scott Walker in 2014, it narrowly supported Tony Evers in 2018 before giving Evers a larger margin of victory in 2022.</p>
