<p>Calumet County (pop. 52,000) is part of the Fox Cities region of Wisconsin, a set of small cities and suburban areas on the shores of Lake Winnebago and south of Green Bay. Calumet County has long been a reliably Republican area, with GOP candidates winning every race for governor since 2000 and all but one presidential and US Senate race, respectively.</p>
