<p>Marinette County (pop. 42,000) is located in the northeastern corner of the state, partially bordered by both Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and Lake Michigan. It’s population is 95% white, with lower levels of college attendance, lower median incomes, and a higher median age than the state average. Politically, the county was fairly competitive in the early 2000s but has since become strongly Republican-leaning.</p>
