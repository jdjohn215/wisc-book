<p>Dunn County (pop. 45,000) is located in the heart of northwestern Wisconsin, about a 75 minute drive west of the Twin Cities. Its population is more white and a bit younger than the state average, but average incomes and educational attainment or similar to Wisconsin overall. Politically, the county shifted from majority Democratic to majority Republican during the Tea Party wave around 2010. Republicans have continued to win most elections since then; athough, Tammy Baldwin narrowly carried Dunn in her 2018 reelection campaign.</p>

<p>About 37% of the county lives in the City of Menomonie, which is home to UW-Stout and is also the most Democratic-leaning community in the county. A few of the other municipalities, like the village of Colfax, are often electorally competitive, but most communities lean solidly Republican.</p>
