<p>Over half the population lives in the City of Eau Claire, home to UW-Eau Claire. Nearly 10,000 more live in the adjacent City of Altoona, the countyâ€™s second largest community. These two cities vote consistently Democratic and are responsible for the countyâ€™s overall tilt, as most of the rural towns vote Republican.</p>
