<p>Waukesha County (pop. 407,000) is Wisconsin’s third largest county and the number one source of Republican votes in the state. It is the largest suburban county in the Milwaukee metro. Waukesha’ s population is very highly educated, relative to state averages, and it has the highest median income. Politically, it has long been a crucial source of votes for Republican statewide candidates. However, since 2016, the county has seen narrowing margins of victory for GOP candidates.</p>

<p>The City of Waukesha (pop. 71,000) is the county’s largest single municipality. It is also the most politically competitive municipality. In 2012, Mitt Romney won the city by 15 points. Trump won it by 10 points in 2016 and 5 points in 2020. Most other municipalities are more Republican-leaning, but they still follow the same general pattern of shifting steadily away from Republican candidates across multiple recent election cycles for president and governor.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of each municipality in the county, as it existed in 2022.</p>
